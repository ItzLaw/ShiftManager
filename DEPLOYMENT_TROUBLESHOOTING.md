# Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. 404 Error for api-service.js
**Problem**: The `api-service.js` file was being loaded from `/api/api-service.js` but the server wasn't serving static files from the `/api` directory.

**Solution**: **INLINED** the `api-service.js` code directly into the HTML file, eliminating the need for external file requests.

### 2. MIME Type Error
**Problem**: The server was returning HTML (404 page) instead of JavaScript, causing strict MIME type checking to fail.

**Solution**: By inlining the JavaScript, we eliminate MIME type issues entirely.

### 3. apiService is not defined
**Problem**: The script was failing to load, so the global `apiService` variable was never created.

**Solution**: The API service is now guaranteed to be available since it's part of the HTML file.

## Current Configuration

### File Structure
```
/
├── index.html              # Main application (with inline API service)
├── api/
│   ├── server.js           # Express server
│   └── database.js         # Database service
└── vercel.json             # Vercel configuration
```

### Vercel Configuration
The `vercel.json` now uses a simple configuration:
- All routes are handled by the server
- No complex static file routing needed

### API Service
The API service is now:
- **Inline** in the HTML file
- No external file dependencies
- Guaranteed to load with the page
- Better performance (no additional HTTP request)

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your Vercel environment:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `NODE_ENV`: Should be set to "production"

## Testing the Deployment

1. **Check API Health**: Visit `/api/health` to verify the server is running
2. **Test API Connection**: Visit `/api/test` to test basic API functionality
3. **Check Console**: Open browser console to see API connection logs
4. **Database Connection**: Verify database connection in server logs

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Database Connection Fails
- Check `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Ensure database is accessible from Vercel's servers
- Check SSL configuration for PostgreSQL

### API Routes Return 404
- Check server.js route definitions
- Verify `vercel.json` routing
- Check server logs for errors

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Check Network Tab**: Verify API calls and responses
3. **Check Server Logs**: Look for server-side errors
4. **Test Individual Endpoints**: Use tools like Postman to test API routes

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All files are in the correct directories
- [ ] Environment variables are set in Vercel
- [ ] Database is accessible from Vercel
- [ ] API routes are responding properly
- [ ] Error handling is working as expected
- [ ] API service is loading (check console for "✅ apiService loaded successfully")

## Benefits of Inline Approach

1. **No 404 errors** for external JavaScript files
2. **No MIME type issues** 
3. **Faster loading** (no additional HTTP request)
4. **Guaranteed availability** of API service
5. **Simpler deployment** (fewer files to manage)
6. **Better caching** (HTML and JS load together)
